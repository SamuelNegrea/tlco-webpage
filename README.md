"# tlco-website" 

Here's a copy I've made of the company's website I'm working for.

Once downloaded or cloned the project type "npm install" in your terminal to install the node_modules.

Once done that, rename the folder "try" to "src" and then type in your terminal "ng serve". In case you haven't installed angular cli already type npm install -g @angular/cli in the terminal before typing "ng serve".

For some strange reason github doesn't allow me to upload src file directly so I ask you to rename from "try" to "src". 

Thank you,

Samuel.
